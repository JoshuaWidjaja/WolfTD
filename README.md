WolfTD is a simple Tower Defense game created in Unity. As of right now the game is fully functional and features the following. I'd like to add some more to the game, given the time.

* 3 different types of turrets
* Level selection 
* Upgradable turrets and shop system
* Different enemy variants and levels
* Retry functionality for levels

You can try out the game by clicking the link: https://themightywolfe.itch.io/wolftd or by downloading it from the Github releases section to the right of the repo page.

Simply download the ZIP file and launch the file titled WolfTD.exe

WolfTD is my first real project created in Unity, and is also the first experience I have had working with the C# language. Since it was my first time, I utilized the help of both Unity and youtube tutorials to help me create the game. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
